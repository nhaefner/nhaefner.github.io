excerpt: 'Digital health and digital pharma are considered supportive tools for patients and healthcare providers (HCPs), making the market highly attractive for industry players. Not surprisingly, Tech Giants have started to move into this area. We utilized established management models and publicly available information sources, such as annual company reports, and performed a thorough analysis to uncover the underlying business models of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, IBM, and Microsoft in order to better understand their intention and process of entering the healthcare and pharma industries. Our results indicate that they do address the needs of patients and physicians, while having built clear value propositions, value chains, and revenue models to sustainably revolutionize the healthcare and pharma industries.'
