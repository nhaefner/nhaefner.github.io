I am an Assistant Professor of Technology Management at the University of St. Gallen. I am affiliated with the [Global Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (GCEI-HSG)](https://gcei.unisg.ch/) and the [Institute of Technology Management (ITEM-HSG)](http://item.unisg.ch) at the [University of St. Gallen](http://www.unisg.ch).

I lead the **Emerging Technologies Lab** at the Institute of Technology Management at the University of St. Gallen. Our focus is on examining and assessing new technologies, especially artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on their impact on innovation, strategic decision-making, the new venture creation process, business models, and business opportunities.
